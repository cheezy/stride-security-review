# check_fixtures.sh — fast parity guard between test/fixtures/ and EXPECTED.md.
#
# The eval suite assumes every fixture file has exactly one EXPECTED.md row and
# every EXPECTED.md row names a fixture that exists on disk. That parity is
# maintained by hand, so it silently breaks the moment someone adds a fixture
# without a row (or deletes a fixture but leaves its row). This script fails
# fast and cheap when the two sets diverge — no API key, no Claude CLI, just a
# set comparison — so CI catches the drift before spending money on the eval.
#
# Exit 0 when the fixture files and the EXPECTED.md rows are in exact parity
# AND the README's eval-runner annotation stays count-agnostic; exit 1 (listing
# the offenders) on parity divergence or a hardcoded README fixture-count
# annotation; exit 2 on a setup error.
